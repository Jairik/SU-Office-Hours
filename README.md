## Stack

The ultimate goal with this project will be to make everything very maintainable and expandable for future maintainers.

Therefore, I will be overengineering the backend using Rust, Axum, and Neon PostgreSQL DB for the backend.

To make everything look pretty, lovely React will be used for the frontend. I plan to procrastinate learning any other frontend framework.
