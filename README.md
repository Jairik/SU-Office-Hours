## Stack

The ultimate goal with this project will be to make everything very maintainable and expandable for future maintainers.

Therefore, to troll, I will be subjecting myself to use Java and Sprintboot for the backend to expose endpoints and interact with the database.

To make everything look pretty, lovely React will be used for the frontend. I plan to procrastinate learning any other frontend framework.
